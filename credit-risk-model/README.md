# Credit Scoring Model Project

## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### Impact of Basel II on Model Interpretability

The Basel II Accord has significantly influenced credit risk modeling by emphasizing the importance of model interpretability. Key impacts include:

1. **Increased Regulatory Scrutiny**: Basel II requires banks to demonstrate that their internal risk models are conceptually sound and empirically validated. This has led to a preference for more interpretable models where decision-making processes can be clearly explained to regulators.

2. **Pillar 1 Requirements**: The accord mandates that credit risk models must adequately differentiate risk and provide accurate probability of default (PD) estimates. Interpretable models help satisfy these requirements by allowing clear validation of risk differentiation logic.

3. **Risk-Weighted Assets Calculation**: Since capital requirements are directly tied to model outputs under Basel II, banks need to understand exactly how their models arrive at risk assessments to ensure proper capital allocation.

4. **Model Documentation**: The accord requires extensive model documentation, which is significantly easier with interpretable models where feature importance and decision pathways are transparent.

### Necessity and Business Risks of Using Proxy Variables

**Necessity:**
- Proxy variables are often used when direct measures of creditworthiness are unavailable due to:
  - Data privacy regulations limiting access to certain financial information
  - Lack of credit history for thin-file or no-file customers
  - Practical constraints in data collection

**Business Risks:**
1. **Model Bias**: Poorly chosen proxies may introduce bias, systematically disadvantaging certain customer segments.
2. **Regulatory Challenges**: Regulators may question the validity of models relying heavily on proxies rather than direct measures.
3. **Performance Instability**: Proxy relationships may change over time, leading to model drift.
4. **Reputational Risk**: Use of controversial proxies (e.g., zip codes as income proxies) can lead to public relations issues.

### Trade-offs: Simple Interpretable Model vs. Complex High-Performer

| Factor                | Simple Interpretable Model          | Complex High-Performing Model       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**          | Lower predictive performance        | Higher accuracy                     |
| **Interpretability**  | Fully transparent logic             | "Black box" nature                  |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Easier to validate and explain | May face regulatory scrutiny        |
| **Implementation**    | Faster to implement and deploy      | Requires more development resources |
| **Maintenance**       | Easier to monitor and update        | More challenging to maintain        |
| **Business Adoption** | Higher stakeholder trust            | Potential skepticism due to opacity |

**Current Industry Practice**: Many institutions use a hybrid approach - simpler models for regulatory reporting and customer-facing decisions, while using complex models for internal risk assessment and portfolio management. The trend towards explainable AI (XAI) techniques is helping bridge this gap.

## Project Setup

This project implements a credit scoring model with:

1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline** (Completed)
   - Automated transformation of raw transaction data
   - Creation of aggregate features (sums, averages, counts)
   - Temporal feature extraction
   - Proper handling of missing values and categorical variables

2. **Model Development** (In Progress)
   - Comparative evaluation of interpretable vs. complex models
   - Implementation of SHAP values for model explainability
   - Regulatory compliance documentation

3. **Validation Framework**
   - Backtesting procedures
   - Bias and fairness testing
   - Stability analysis for proxy variables

## Interim Submission Status

The current submission demonstrates:
- Completed feature engineering pipeline in 
- Configuration management for different modeling approaches
- Documentation of business considerations in this README
